# Vue Web Components

> An example project for creating re-usable web components using vue js that can be consumed in any frontend

This project accompanies _this blog (tbc)_ and demonstrates how a re-usable component library can be built rapidly using [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) and used like native web components.

## Requirements

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - Build and package web components
- [.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) - (Optional) - used to demo components in non-js framework

## Getting started

Build the components with the following command from the `/components/` directory

```sh
npm i && npx webpack
```

Start the dotnet development server from the root directory

```sh
dotnet run
```

Then browse to http://localhost:5000 to view the components.
